### What I learned

Hello everyone! In this project I learned how to create a tooltip. I don't think I've had to create one in past projects, but it was pretty simple. I found out how to do it on W3Schools website. I do feel that this project got a little unorganized towards the end, but please if there is a better way to do anything, let me know, I would greatly appreciate it :D
